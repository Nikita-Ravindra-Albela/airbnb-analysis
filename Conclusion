## What Business Problems Did the Dashboard Help Solve?

 1. Identified how location and property type drive price fluctuations → helping hosts set competitive, revenue-maximizing prices.

2. Understanding Occupancy Drivers
Found that listings with stronger reviews & ratings consistently achieve higher occupancy → highlighting the ROI of service quality.

3. Identifying High-Performing & Underperforming Areas
Popular neighborhoods show stable demand, while weaker locations need targeted offers and experience improvements → guiding marketing and investment decisions.

4. Improving Host Strategy
Patterns revealed which host behaviors (responsiveness, amenities, clarity) correlate with better engagement → enabling hosts to refine listing strategy.

## Key Takeaways

Location is the #1 factor influencing price & demand

High-rated hosts win more bookings

Certain property types perform best in tourist-heavy areas

Underperforming areas can boost demand with seasonal offers & better guest experience
